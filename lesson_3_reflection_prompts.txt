When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I'm collaborating with other people, when I'm working on more than one 
    computer, or as an offsite backup of my work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If you are using the files in an application, you don't want it to change
    behavior until you are ready.  This way, you can go back to a prevous 
    version right away if there is a problem.  Also other people won't need
    to pull the version until they know it is debugged.  Not everyone will want
    to use the latest version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    These are different ways to copy a repository.  A fork copies a repository
    from one Github account to yours, so you can make changes without affecting
    the original.  A clone copies an entire repository from one place which can
    be Github, to your own computer. A branch is a label on the commit tree
    where a commit diverges from the master, so that development can go in
    different directions simultaneously without the branches interferring with
	each other.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
